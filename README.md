Simple crystal counting game with vanilla JS & jQuery.

Each game begins with 4 crystals containing a random number, as well as a goal number to reach. In order to win, and gain a point, users must click on the crystals to discover their hidden number. Players should continue clicking until they reach the goal number and gain a point. If the player goes over the desired number, they lose and the game restarts.
